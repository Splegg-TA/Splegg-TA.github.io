      <h1>STA ELO ratings</h1>
      <p>
        The following table lists every player who has ever played in an
        official STA/EGA tournament. Matches that happened outside of STA/EGA
        tournaments will not be counted - neither will matches that have been
        played in any previous tournaments due to a lack of regulations,
        comparability and objectivity. A match counts once at least 1 round has
        officially been played. 
        Only legitimately won, tied or lost matches count towards the ELO.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official STA team ELO ratings - matches that include more than 2
        players - can be found here. Team ELO is calculated seperately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratings solely depend on who you play. The round, tournament and/or
        circumstances are irrelevant and do not affect the ELO standings at all.
        Currently the classic ELO-rating method by Arpad Elo is being used with
        k=40 and the range (divisor) being 300.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
        Updates happen after every tournament stage. If there is just one stage the ELO will be updated
        when over 87% of all matches have been played. Ultimately the ELO, if need be, will be updated every two months after the start of a tournament.
        </p>
