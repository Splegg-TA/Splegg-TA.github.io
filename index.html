      <h1>STA ELO ratings</h1>
      <p>
        The following table lists every player who has ever participated in an
        official STA tournament. Matches that happened outside of STA
        tournaments will not be counted - neither will matches that have been
        played in any previous tournaments due to a lack of regulations,
        comparability and objectivity. A match counts once at least 1 round has
        officially been played. Matches in which the opponent has violated rule
        No. 3 (used any kind of illegal 3rd party programs) do not count.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official STA team ELO ratings - matches that include more than 2
        players - can be found here. Team ELO is calculated seperately.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ratings solely depend on who you play. The round, tournament and/or
        circumstances are irrelevant and do not affect the ELO standings at all.
        Currently the classic ELO-rating method by Arpad Elo is being used with
        k=40 and the range (divisor) being 300.
